Although it is difficult to give precise definitions \\nfor these terms, a consensus exists about the general areas covered by each. For \\nexample, see [VRAN80], [SIEW82], and [BELL78a]; an interesting alternative view \\nis presented in [REDD76].\\nComputer architecture refers to those attributes of a system visible to a pro-\\ngrammer or, put another way, those attributes that have a direct impact on the \\nlogical execution of a program. A term that is often used interchangeably with com-\\nputer architecture is instruction set architecture (ISA). The ISA defines instruction \\nformats, instruction opcodes, registers, instruction and data memory; the effect of \\nexecuted instructions on the registers and memory; and an algorithm for control-\\nling instruction execution. Computer organization refers to the operational units \\nand their interconnections that realize the architectural specifications. Examples of \\narchitectural attributes include the instruction set, the number of bits used to repre-\\nsent various data types (e.g., numbers, characters), I/O mechanisms, and techniques \\nfor addressing memory. Organizational attributes include those hardware details \\ntransparent to the programmer, such as control signals; interfaces between the com-\\nputer and peripherals; and the memory technology used.\\nFor example, it is an architectural design issue whether a computer will have \\na multiply instruction. It is an organizational issue whether that instruction will be \\nimplemented by a special multiply unit or by a mechanism that makes repeated \\nuse of the add unit of the system. The organizational decision may be based on the \\nanticipated frequency of use of the multiply instruction, the relative speed of the \\ntwo approaches, and the cost and physical size of a special multiply unit.\\nHistorically, and still today, the distinction between architecture and organ-\\nization has been an important one. Many computer manufacturers offer a family of \\ncomputer models, all with the same architecture but with differences in organization. \\nConsequently, the different models in the family have different price and perform-\\nance characteristics. Furthermore, a particular architecture may span many years \\nand encompass a number of different computer models, its organization changing \\nwith changing technology. A prominent example of both these phenomena is the \\nIBM System/370 architecture. This architecture was first introduced in 1970 and \\nLearning Objectives\\nAfter studying this chapter, you should be able to:\\nr\\nr Explain the general functions and structure of a digital computer.\\nr\\nr Present an overview of the evolution of computer technology from early \\ndigital computers to the latest microprocessors.\\nr\\nr Present an overview of the evolution of the x86 architecture.\\nr\\nr Define embedded systems and list some of the requirements and constraints \\nthat various embedded systems must meet.\\n'"

    "the board. The main printed circuit board in a computer is called a system board\n",
    "or motherboard, while smaller ones that plug into the slots in the main board are\n",
    "called expansion boards.\n",
    "The most prominent elements on the motherboard are the chips. A chip is\n",
    "a single piece of semiconducting material, typically silicon, upon which electronic\n",
    "circuits and logic gates are fabricated. The resulting product is referred to as an\n",

    "The motherboard contains a slot or socket for the processor chip, which typ-\n",
    "ically contains multiple individual cores, in what is known as a multicore processor.\n",
    "There are also slots for memory chips, I/O controller chips, and other key computer\n",
    "components. For desktop computers, expansion slots enable the inclusion of more\n",
    "components on expansion boards. Thus, a modern motherboard connects only a\n",
    "few individual chip components, with each chip containing from a few thousand up\n",

A computer’s operating environment consists of devices that serve as either sources or destinations of data. Data storage is stored on the computer for subsequent retrieval and update. Within the computer, a control unit manages the computer's resources and orchestrates the performance of its functional parts in response to instructions. A traditional computer with a single processor that employs a microprogrammed. unit, then examine a typical multicore structure of a. traditional computer. A typical computer with two or three processors that employ a. multicore system, then look at the internal structure of. a. processor that uses two or more processors. A. computer with four processors that use five or six processors, and so on, and a. computer that uses six or seven processors, that uses seven or eight processors. The computer with the most processors, such as the Intel Core i7, can run at speeds of up to 1.5 to 2.5 gigahertz (GHz) A. processor with the same or less power as the one in this book can run for as little as 1 hour and 20 minutes. A processor with more than 1.2 hours of power can last for up to 24 hours. A single processor with a maximum of 1.6 hours of battery life can last up to two days. A system with a lot of power, like the Apple II, can last longer than two hours and a half. A high-performance computer can last more than three hours and even longer. A low-powered computer can take up to four hours to run. A machine with a low-power, low-cost processor can last a few hours and up to five hours. An inexpensive computer can run all day and into the night. A small computer can do it in a matter of hours, but it's not cheap. A large computer can't do it for a long time. It's not possible to do it all at once.\""
